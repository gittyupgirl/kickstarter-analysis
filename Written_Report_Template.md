# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The objective of this project was to identify how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

1369 campaigns were tabled and charted, based on number of successes, failures and cancellations by month of launch. Based on the launch date of theater campaigns from 2009 to 2017, the greatest number of campaigns were launched in May, with a steady decline through September. October saw a slight increase, with launches decreasing through the remainder of the year. The fewest number of campaigns were launched in December. 

Successful campaigns outnumbered failed campaigns throughout the year. ![See chart](https://github.com/gittyupgirl/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

1047 plays were analyzed by goal size for success and failure - there were no cancelled plays. This resulted in only two categories for a % success/fail analysis, with each category in the line graph representing the inverse of the other.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

When analyzing theater outcomes based on launch date, more valuable analysis can be done to consider the speed of success based on launch date, or the pledges vs. goal based on launch date. The country should be considered as well.  The analysis currently presented is of marginal value. Given the information in this chart, one might initially assume that May is a favorable month to begin a campaign, but we are seeing more successes and failures in May simply because there were significantly more launches in that month. 

For the Outcomes Based on Goals analysis, more value could be gained by examining additional factors that may have contributed to the success and failure of the campaigns within each goal category, as well as the average percentage funded. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. When they are more launches in a given month, you will naturally have more successes and failures. 
2. December may be an unfavorable month to launch a campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Smaller campaigns were more likely to be successful than larger campaigns.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - This dataset would benefit from a column to represent the number of days a campaign took to reach its goal.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - Speed of success for campaigns could be represented if we were to calculate a column for the number of days between launch and end.
  - Success by month by country could help visualize when and where campaigns are most successful.
